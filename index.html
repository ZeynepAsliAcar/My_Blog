      <h2>Hello! I’m Zeynep Aslı</h2>
      <p class="date">July 21, 2025</p>
      <p>
        As I dive into the world of software, my excitement and thirst for knowledge grow every day.
        Today, I want to share something close to my heart: <strong>staying active and living life to the fullest.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In my daily routine, I prioritize exercise and outdoor walks. It’s crucial to keep both mind and body healthy with small but effective activities. Don’t forget to move throughout your day!
